## Example: Alias table for gene

This table (produced for each gene entry) translates the Ensembl IDs
used in the C2M@ into a variety of other gene accessions and
identifiers.

It is produced by the script [build-markdown-pieces-gene-translate.py](https://github.com/nih-cfde/update-content-registry/blob/main/scripts/build-markdown-pieces-gene-translate.py).

This is a good example of a script that uses auxiliary information -
here, a TSV file that maps Ensembl IDs to other identifiers - to produce
its annotations.
